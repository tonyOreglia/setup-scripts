# Setting up TiddlyWiki over the web

## Niginx Config

## tiddlyweb setup 

The important thing is the file "$__config_tiddlyweb_host.tid" 

Make sure to escpape the '$' character when creating the file, otherwise it will treat it as a variable. 

If you have an error writing to the StoryList tiddle, check the path. If it's not using the proper path i.e. /tw/ or whateve,r then this tiddle is not being read correcly.
